## CobaltArchiver
A file extraction and compression software based on 7Z.
It doesn't offer any significant advantage—just lacks a file explorer, which is precisely what I needed.

## To do list
* support encrypted archives

## How to Run
Run the Python file or download the zip file from the Releases page.

## Third-Party Resources
Icon from icons8.com
7z.exe and 7z.dll files from the 7z software, used under its license.
